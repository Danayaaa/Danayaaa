🧚🏼‍♀️ I'm Dania Mariz C. Notado, currently studying Information Technology with a specialization in 
Business Analytics at FEU Institute of Technology. I'm 20 years old and I am from General Trias, Cavite.

🧚🏼‍♀️ In my first year of college, I was recognized as a Top Performing Student, showing my commitment to doing well in my studies. My personal goal is to keep getting better at what I do and find success. Professionally, I want to be really good at design and editing.

🧚🏼‍♀️ I really enjoy creating interfaces. I hope to bring more creativity and leave a lasting mark in the IT industry.
